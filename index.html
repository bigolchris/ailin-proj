              This Portfolio was made for a personal interest project for an
              English class. The concept or essential question that this project
              revolves around was, “How can the influence of different
              photographers with different backgrounds add more meaning behind
              my photographs?”. To answer this question I decided that I was
              <img class="sub-img" src="IMG_3988.jpeg" alt="" />
              going to make a portfolio of photographs after researching a
              couple of photographers and their work. The key elements that I
              was trying to focus on was, what made the photographs meaningful
              and what gave the photographs soul. The photographers that I
              centered my attention on were, Jesus Manuel Garza, Oscar B.
              Castillo, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Ernest Cole and Graciela
              Interbide.

              I was born in Petaluma CA and am currently a sophomore in highschool. I  discovered photography through some of my older cousins. I always saw them bring their cameras to family gatherings or events and it sparked my interest. Later in my freshman year of highschool I decided I would take a photography class and I loved it. Since then I continue to use the skills I learned and continue my passion of photography.
